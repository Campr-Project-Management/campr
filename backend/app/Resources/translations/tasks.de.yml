            <p>Congratulations - your project is successfully created! CAMPR is an intuitive program that you will love to work with and this introduction describes how to utilize the tools to make your experience with CAMPR as convenient as possible.</p>

            <p>CAMPR knows that every project is different and allows you to customize your settings to optimize your work. Our ADMIN SECTION is available to you as a project manager. Here you can configure the settings which are relevant for your project. It's best to set up things up before the project starts, but of course, changes or additions are possible at any time during your project.</p>

            <p>You will notice that some entries are already predefined, but you can personalize your settings in the ADMIN SECTION to your own needs regarding your individual project environment. Completing the next four tasks optimizes your CAMPR settings to your project needs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Project Settings</li>
                <li>Organization</li>
                <li>Costs</li>
                <li>Nice to have</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It's best to change your settings right away, but as mentioned before, you can always go back and make changes. These default tasks disappear automatically after 5 days. Incidentally, they have no influence on the degree of completion of your project - they are only memory aids.</p>
