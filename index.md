## First steps in CAMPR
- Create a Workspace
- Create a Project with the Project Creation Wizard
- Invite your team

### Create a Workspace

CAMPR is organized in workspaces. Within those workspaces, you can set up projects. You can have an infinite number of both workspaces and projects.
After creating and activating your account, you should set up your first workspace. Go to “workspace” in the top right corner to open the list of workspaces you are the owner of and to set up new ones. 

We also prepared a video for you to guide you through the first steps:

### The project creation wizard

A click on “add project” in the workspace dashboard.

In the **first step**, you add some basic information about the project such as name, logo and currency.
The **second step** requires some information on the nature of your project. Add information about the duration, size of the project team, budget and strategic meaning of the project. Based on the inputs of step two, the Project Creation Wizard will suggest the modules you need for the successful management of your project in **step three**.
There are X modules every project needs which and which cannot be deselected. The modules are **Project Contract, Organization, Taskmanagement, Status and Close Out Report**. All other modules not mandatory and can be activated and deactivated even when the project has already started.

### Invite your team

After you have completed the three steps of the project wizard, you have successfully set up a project. Now you can fill the project with life and invite your team. Set up your team in the module “organization” by clicking on “Invite Member to Workspace” and entering the email address of your team members (one at a time).

## The Modules

As you have probably already heard, CAMPR offers 16 modules covering all areas of the project life cycle. You can find a detailed rundown on all modules, functions and labels.

### Project Contract

The project contract is a framework agreement between the project sponsor and the project manager and includes all known information about the project such as deliverables, objectives and limitations, but also resources and a general description.

- **Project Scope**: The Project Scope is generally defined as the work performed to deliver a product, service or result within the specified features and functions.
- **Project Category**: The Project Category can be used as a filter in case you have a wide variety of projects running at the same time. It basically is another dimension to the project type and is completely up to your organizational structure.
- **Freeze Project Contract**: Once the Project Manager and the Sponsor find an agreement, the Contract can be frozen which makes it impossible for the parties to edit the contract afterwards.
- **Project Description**: Describe the project in as detailed as you like. Please note that it is also possible to add images!
- **Project Start Event**: Describe your Starting Event. Schedule: Add a starting and an end date to the project to set the base dates for the whole project.

- **Project Team**: You can add your project team in the “Organization” Module. Your Team and team structure will be featured on the PDF version of the project contract.
- **Project Objectives**: Describes the desired results of the project.
- **Project Limitations**: Restriction that defines the projects limitations of what is not desired to be accomplished.
- **Project Deliverables**: tangible or intangible goods or services that result from or are to be delivered during the project.
- **Internal Costs**: Internal Costs are the cost that incur inside your organization. Usually the largest block are wages for employees which is often underestimated and not always taken into account for example when calculating the costs of a Project Kickoff event.
- **External Costs**: External Costs are expenses for outside services, investments in machinery or tools and others.
- **Download PDF**: You can export the Project Contract as PDF to print and sign.

### Organization

The “Organization” module allows you to manage your project team efficiently. You can set up a hierarchy and rights, manage distribution lists and add members to the RASCI matrix to manage their responsibilities.
