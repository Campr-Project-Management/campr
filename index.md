## First steps in CAMPR
- Create a Workspace
- Create a Project with the Project Creation Wizard
- Invite your team

### Create a Workspace

CAMPR is organized in workspaces. Within those workspaces, you can set up projects. You can have an infinite number of both workspaces and projects.
After creating and activating your account, you should set up your first workspace. Go to “workspace” in the top right corner to open the list of workspaces you are the owner of and to set up new ones. 


### The project creation wizard

A click on “add project” in the workspace dashboard. 
![Workspace-Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101017696-ba19f180-356a-11eb-959e-22167f4c103e.jpg) This will start the three-step Project Creation Wizard. 

In the **first step**, you add some basic information about the project such as name, logo and currency.
The **second step** requires some information on the nature of your project. Add information about the duration, size of the project team, budget and strategic meaning of the project. Based on the inputs of step two, the Project Creation Wizard will suggest the modules you need for the successful management of your project in **step three**.
There are X modules every project needs which and which cannot be deselected. The modules are **Project Contract, Organization, Taskmanagement, Status and Close Out Report**. All other modules not mandatory and can be activated and deactivated even when the project has already started.

### Invite your team

After you have completed the three steps of the project wizard, you have successfully set up a project. Now you can fill the project with life and invite your team. Set up your team in the module “organization” by clicking on “Invite Member to Workspace” and entering the email address of your team members (one at a time).

We also prepared a video for you to guide you through the first steps:

## The Modules

As you have probably already heard, CAMPR offers 16 modules covering all areas of the project life cycle. You can find a detailed rundown on all modules, functions and labels.

### Project Contract

The project contract is a framework agreement between the project sponsor and the project manager and includes all known information about the project such as deliverables, objectives and limitations, but also resources and a general description.

![The Project Contract](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101017496-73c49280-356a-11eb-9319-843a077bd4ac.PNG)

- **Project Scope**: The Project Scope is generally defined as the work performed to deliver a product, service or result within the specified features and functions.
- **Project Category**: The Project Category can be used as a filter in case you have a wide variety of projects running at the same time. It basically is another dimension to the project type and is completely up to your organizational structure.
- **Freeze Project Contract**: Once the Project Manager and the Sponsor find an agreement, the Contract can be frozen which makes it impossible for the parties to edit the contract afterwards.
- **Project Description**: Describe the project in as detailed as you like. Please note that it is also possible to add images!
- **Project Start Event**: Describe your Starting Event. Schedule: Add a starting and an end date to the project to set the base dates for the whole project. 

![Project Contract #2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101017494-732bfc00-356a-11eb-8352-838458570055.PNG)

- **Project Team**: You can add your project team in the “Organization” Module. Your Team and team structure will be featured on the PDF version of the project contract.
- **Project Objectives**: Describes the desired results of the project.
- **Project Limitations**: Restriction that defines the projects limitations of what is not desired to be accomplished.
- **Project Deliverables**: tangible or intangible goods or services that result from or are to be delivered during the project.
- **Internal Costs**: Internal Costs are the cost that incur inside your organization. Usually the largest block are wages for employees which is often underestimated and not always taken into account for example when calculating the costs of a Project Kickoff event.
- **External Costs**: External Costs are expenses for outside services, investments in machinery or tools and others.
- **Download PDF**: You can export the Project Contract as PDF to print and sign.


### Organization

The “Organization” module allows you to manage your project team efficiently. You can set up a hierarchy and rights, manage distribution lists and add members to the RASCI matrix to manage their responsibilities.

![003_Orga 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101017469-6f987500-356a-11eb-9843-d90c74d2b16e.PNG)

### Edit Project Organization

You can set up a hierarchy through this menu.

![004_Orga 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136312-6d3b2700-360d-11eb-8cbf-5b16e742e7f9.PNG)

- **Members**: This menu gives you another quick overview of all project members and allows you to manage your team.
- **Departments**: You can add departments, add members to those departments and select a department head. Departments are displayed on the hierarchical level below the project manager.
- **Subteams**: Subteams are teams within the departments. You can select subteam members and a team leader.
- **Sponsor**: The Sponsor is the owner of the project and either represented by a single person or a group. Please note that you can only have one project sponsor.

![005_Orga](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136313-6d3b2700-360d-11eb-92fa-9de3332db1ff.PNG)

- **Invite Member to Workspace**: The easiest way to add more members to the workspace. All you need to do is inserting the email address of the designated member, so he can link his account with your workspace.
- **Create Distribution List**: You can have more than just one distribution list for the status report. If you have regular meetings with the same staff and you want to use the “Meeting” module, you can add a distribution list with those members. 

(**PRO TIPP**: After naming the distribution list, a new column similar to “Status Report Distribution” is created. Create a blank distribution list and add members through the 	table.)
- **RASCI**: You choose if a member is activated for the RASCI module.
- **Status Report Distribution**: Members activated for the Status Report Distribution List will receive an email with the PDF of the status report every time you decide to create a new status report.


### Phases & Milestones

Start scheduling your project here. Set up phases first to determine the separate project segments and milestones to mark important events. You can further set up subphases and key milestones.

![006_P M](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136314-6dd3bd80-360d-11eb-9c97-5fb419841cae.PNG)

- **Phase**: A phase is a bundle of related work packages. In classic project management, there are five phases: initiation, planning, executing, monitoring and closing.
- **Milestone**: A milestone marks an important event such as the achievement of a deliverable. They help determining and monitoring the project process and whether or not it is on schedule. 
- **Base Schedule**: when setting up the phase, milestone or task, the initially set dates represent the base dates.
- **Forecast Schedule**: When editing the dates in any way, the edited dates are forecast dates
- **Actual Schedule**: CAMPR is a real-time tool, so the actual dates are calculated automatically.

![007_P M](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136315-6dd3bd80-360d-11eb-8ec8-12936a29a9d4.PNG)

- **Create new phase**: here you can set up phases. Add a title and description, set the base date and select a person responsible for the completion of the phase. In more complex projects it might make sense to set up subphases for a clearer structure.


### Task Management

The Task Management provides an overview of all work packages assigned to the project. A work package is a group of associated tasks. Typical categories for grouped tasks are geographical area, engineering discipline, technology, or the time needed to accomplish them. The task board provides a quick overview of tasks, status, progress, label and assignee. There are five status categories: Open, Pending, Ongoing, Completed and Closed. Keep in mind that all calculations (scheduling and costs) are ultimately based on tasks.

![008_TM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136317-6e6c5400-360d-11eb-9747-6f100d763b54.PNG)

- **See Grid**: You have the choice between the gridview and the board view. The gridview allows you to get more details such as budget, attachments, comments and subtasks. 
- **Edit Labels**: Add labels to your tasks to navigate quickly through your tasks. You can choose color and name of the label and mark your tasks.
- **Add Task**: Since a project is ultimately just a large number of individual and coordinated tasks, this menu is the heart of the planning functions of CAMPR and require the most input. 
  - **General**: Task Name and Description
  - **Scheduling**: add the task to a phase and set the base dates
  - **Costs**: you can set up each separate position of internal and external costs in detail
  - **Assignments**: select which functions your members have in the task
  - **Other**: you can set up subtasks that will be shown as a to-do list in the task, set the status and label and attach documents.
  

  ### Risk & Opportunity
  
Risk Management might be the most underestimated successfactor in project management. The module is designed to help you monitor and estimate risk impacts and allow you to decide quicker and be proactive. Beside monetary impact of risks, you can also monitor project time impacts. A risk is by definition neutral and can therefore have a positive or negative impact. Positive impacts (potential savings) are labeled “Opportunities” while negative impacts (additional costs) are labeled “Risks”.

![009_RM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136318-6e6c5400-360d-11eb-88f8-046bd92a12a7.PNG)

- **Measures**: when setting up a new Risk (or Opportunity), you can add measures that would prevent (or induce) the event. 
- **Potential Savings**: The financial or time advantage you can achieve when taking all suggested measures at the total cost the measures come with.

![010_RM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136319-6e6c5400-360d-11eb-99ed-53005dae4a7d.PNG)

New Opportunity: 

- **General**: Name and describe the Opportunity (the Risk)
- **Impact & Probability**: Both values are important for the placement in the chart. The impact describes the general impact on the project progress, while the probability is simply the probability of the event happening. The probability is displayed on the	 x-axis, the impact on the y-axis. 
- **Savings (Opportunity)**: Add potential savings both in terms of money and time. The potential savings will be calculated as the product of the probability and the savings.
- **Cost (Risk)**: Similar to the savings, you can add the value that is at risk or the extra costs in terms of money and time. Again, the  potential costs are the product of	probability and costs.
- **Strategy and Status**: You can choose between different strategies. For Opportunities you can choose between: share, enhance and ignore. For Risks, you can choose between: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate. You create more Strategies and	Status in the admin section.
- **Measures**: You can add measures to deal with the risk. Name and describe the	 measure and add the execution costs. You will be able to see the combined costs of all measures and opportunities (or risks) in the general Risk & Opportunity tab.


### Gantt Chart

The Gantt chart is the go-to PM tool for scheduling. It allows you to get a good overview of crucial elements and dependencies of your project. The module offers a minimap, a list of tasks, grouped in phases and an interactive Gantt chart. Above the task list, you can see three tabs: Base, Forecast and Actual.

![011_Gantt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136320-6f04ea80-360d-11eb-9340-b89103b83442.PNG)

- **Base-Tab**: the base tab shows all base dates of your project. The dark color of the bar visualizes the progress of the task or phase. A task that has not been started yet is therefore light green. You can change the progress of tasks (but not of phases since those are calculated) by simply dragging the progress bar.
- **Forecast-Tab**: The forecast tab allows you to adjust the forecasted times of the tasks.
- **Actual-Tab**: here you can see the actual time needed to finish the tasks.


### RASCI Matrix

![012_RASCI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136322-6f04ea80-360d-11eb-9e5e-9e054b7236db.PNG)

The RASCI Matrix is a very simple yet efficient tool to delegate responsibilities of single tasks to your project members. The header shows the profile pictures of the members, the first column the name of the task and you can simply choose the role of each member for each task. As mentioned earlier there must be one member marked as responsible and accountable. All other roles can be assigned to multiple members and are optional.


### Work-Breakdown-Structure (WBS)

![013_WBS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136323-6f04ea80-360d-11eb-8c97-c2ea55d03baf.PNG)

The WBS visualizes the project structure as a tree. The first box on the left represents the project, splitting up into phases which are splitting up into tasks and milestones.

Lets take a closer look at the boxes.

![014_WBS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136294-6ad8cd00-360d-11eb-9474-59543ecc18ad.PNG)

- **Task ID**: 11
- **Task name**: DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER
- **Actual starting date**: 03.09.19
- **Actual finish date**: N/A
- **Task status**: ONGOING
- **Progress**: 75%

This task condition is marked with a “warning” represented by the yellow frame. A task marked “critical” is marked with a red frame.

### Meetings

The whole Meeting module consist of four different module: **Meetings, To Do’s, Infos and Decisions**. The modules and their core functions are presented in the following subchapters.

Create a Meeting

The core function of the four modules. You can set detailed agendas, create minutes or templates for decisions and invite the designated participants.

![015_Meeting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136297-6b716380-360d-11eb-890d-37d9ebc79740.PNG)

On the top left side you can enter the general details for the meeting such as date & time, location and meeting objectives. You can also select the distribution list you want to use for the invitation. 
On the right side you see the list of participants including checkboxes for participation and distribution list.
(PRO TIPP: it is always useful to create distribution lists beforehand. It is not possible to create a distribution list through this menu, only through the organization module.)

![016_Meeting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136299-6c09fa00-360d-11eb-871e-ae6be5013e9a.PNG)

You have the option to set up a detailed agenda for the whole meeting, including responsibility and duration. Please make sure the duration adds up in the end or you will not be able to save the meeting!

### Decisions, To-do's, Infos

![017_decision](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136300-6c09fa00-360d-11eb-8366-acadf3d20350.PNG)

Decision templates are a practical tool to not get lost and make the decision-making process more efficient. The from is very lean and only includes description, responsibility, due date and status. Similar templates are available for Infos and To-Do’s and can either be created separately in those modules or when setting up a new meeting.


### Status Report

![018_status report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136301-6c09fa00-360d-11eb-972e-516efa737a5a.PNG)

The status report provides you with a cross-section of your project that can be used for presentations, general reporting and monitoring. The status report consist of information about the project at the exact moment the report is created. It uses data from all tasks and phases, decisions and risks to create a multi-page summary of the current state of your project. 
(**PRO TIPP**: it is very important to keep all tasks up to date to get the most exact reflection of your project’s condition. Try to synchronize your team updating their work in CAMPR with the creation of the status report- i.e. update team Thursday, creation report Friday.)
- **Overall Status**: The overall status is based on the status of each task 
- **Project Trend**: the project trend line is calculated based on the task completion over time.
- **Other**: You will recognize excerpts of all modules - Cost modules, Risk & Opportunity, Phases & Milestones etc. See the descriptions above for more information on the separate segments.

### Project Close Out

All projects come to an end - with this module, you will be able to finish the project properly. The point of this module is besides evaluating the project success, to plan the next steps, learn from the project and have a final document in contrast to the project contract.

![019_close out report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63300071/101136303-6ca29080-360d-11eb-9071-ec6806856bd3.PNG)

The input fields are fairly straight forward:
- **Overall impression**: how did the project go? What obstacles did you have to	 overcome? Sum up the project in a couple of sentences.
- **Evaluation Objective**: Which area needs to be looked at more closely again?
- **Lessons Learned**: What has to be done differently to ensure future projects to	succeed or perform better/smoother than this one? 
- **Reflection**: Final thoughts and a critical reflection of the schedule, the organization and the management of the project.
