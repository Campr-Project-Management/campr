## First steps in CAMPR
- Create a Workspace
- Create a Project with the Project Creation Wizard
- Invite your team

### Create a Workspace

CAMPR is organized in workspaces. Within those workspaces, you can set up projects. You can have an infinite number of both workspaces and projects.
After creating and activating your account, you should set up your first workspace. Go to “workspace” in the top right corner to open the list of workspaces you are the owner of and to set up new ones. 

We also prepared a video for you to guide you through the first steps.

### The project creation wizard

A click on “add project” in the workspace dashboard. [screenshot WS dashboard] This will start the three-step Project Creation Wizard. 
In the **first step**, you add some basic information about the project such as name, logo and currency.
The **second step** requires some information on the nature of your project. Add information about the duration, size of the project team, budget and strategic meaning of the project. Based on the inputs of step two, the Project Creation Wizard will suggest the modules you need for the successful management of your project in **step three**.
There are X modules every project needs which and which cannot be deselected. The modules are **Project Contract, Organization, Taskmanagement, Status and Close Out Report**. All other modules not mandatory and can be activated and deactivated even when the project has already started.

### Invite your team

Projects are teamwork. Set up your team in the module “organization” by clicking on “Invite Member to Workspace” and entering the email address of your team members (one at a time).
