# Are you a language genius?
We would like CAMPR to be used by many satisfied users in many countries around the world. For this we need your support!

Would you like to translate CAMPR into your language? Don't worry, this is not rocket science! We manage our language packages with [LOCALIZE](https://localizejs.com/de/). German, English and Swedish are already included - your language is still missing we guess.

Interested? Then [Hannes](mailto:hannes.breese@campr.biz) will gladly help you.
